# CLA Enforcer

CLA Enforcer is a GitHub and DocuSign API integration to automate a CLA process
for open source projects.

## Installation

1. [Create a GitHub Application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
   and optionally [a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) that will be used
   to leave comments on and tag pull requests. Specify your `HOSTNAME` as the
   `Homepage URL` and `HOSTNAME/authorize` as the `Authorization callback URL`.
2. [Sign up for the DocuSign API](https://www.docusign.com/developer-center/get-started).
3. [Fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
4. Modify the default [views](app/views) and [templates](lib/templates) as
   needed.
5. Press the 'Deploy to Heroku' button below.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Usage

After you've deployed CLA Enforcer to Heroku, it's time to enable it for the
relevant repositories.

* Make sure that the account you've used for `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` is added as
   an explicit collaborator to the repository.

* Install Heroku command line app:

```bash
brew install heroku
```

* Clone your newly created Heroku app:

```bash
heroku git:clone -a [yourappname]
cd [yourappname]
```

* Enable the GitHub pull request creation webhook:

```bash
heroku run rake cla:enforce[username/repository]
```

* See what else you can do:

```bash
heroku run rake -D
```

## Configuration

The CLA Enforcer comes with generic templates for the CLA form, and comment
bodies. We expect you to customize them before deploying CLA Enforcer.

### Templates

Templates are used when commenting on pull requests or generating a PDF file
containing the CLA.

* [cla.html.erb](lib/templates/cla.html.erb) - the actual CLA document in HTML.
  The contents of this document will be rendered into a PDF document that will
  be emailed out to contributors using the DocuSign API.

* [request_signature.md.erb](lib/templates/request_signature.md.erb) - used
  when requesting a contributor to sign the CLA. The rendered content of this
  template will be posted as a comment on a pull request from contributors that
  haven't signed the CLA.

* [cla_signed.md.erb](lib/templates/cla_signed.md.erb) - used when confirming
  that a contributor has indeed signed the CLA. The rendered content of this
  template will be posted as a comment on pull requests after their authors
  have signed the CLA.

* [cla_enabled.md.erb](lib/templates/cla_enabled.md.erb) - used when announcing
  the establishment of the CLA process on an existing repository. The rendered
  content of this template will be posted in the body of the issue announcing
  the CLA process. This template should mention all existing contributors by
  their GitHub username to get their attention as well as provide instructions
  on how to begin the CLA process.

### Views

Views are Sinatra templates that display information to the user.

* [index.erb](app/views/index.erb) - the home page. A perfect place for
  explaining the rationale behind the CLA process as well as how it works.

* [form.erb](app/views/form.erb) - displays the CLA form.

* [accepted.erb](app/views/accepted.erb) - displays a thank you message after
  the CLA form has been submitted. Should show the email address that the CLA
  file has been sent to, as well as a link to the CLA status page.

* [status.erb](app/views/status.erb) - displays the CLA status as reported via
  webhooks by the DocuSign API. Also allows restarting the CLA process.

Note that the instructions below assume `https://cla-enforcer.ngrok.com/`
hostname, feel free to use any other hostname, this one is given as an example.

* Clone this repository.
* [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io/).
* Download and install CLA Enforcer's dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

* [Download ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).
* Start ngrok with the `cla-enforcer` subdomain and forwarding to port `3000`:

```bash
ngrok -log=stdout -subdomain cla-enforcer 3000
```

* [Register a GitHub application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
  with `https://cla-enforcer.ngrok.com/` as the `Homepage URL` and
  `https://cla-enforcer.ngrok.com/authorize` as the `Authorization callback URL`.

* Create `.env` file in the repository root by modifying defaults in [`.env.sample`](.env.sample).
  Make sure to set the `HOSTNAME` to `https://cla-enforcer.ngrok.com/` and
  `PORT` to `3000`.

* Start CLA Enforcer:

```bash
bundle exec dotenv bin/cla-enforcer
```

* Navigate to the CLA Enforcer web interface:

```bash
open https://cla-enforcer.ngrok.com/
```

* After you're done, shut down ngrok and cla enforcer by pressing `CTRL+C` in
  their appropriate terminal tabs.

## How it works

CLA Enforcer is designed to easily run on Heroku's free tier. It consists of a
Sinatra website served by Puma (Webapp) and a background worker (Worker)
communicating over a Unix domain socket and sharing a PostgreSQL database
(Database). You can easily have multiple instances of the API and Workers
running across multiple Heroku dynos if necessary.

The Webapp is responsible for rendering views and receiving form submissions
and webhooks. After validating webhooks and form submissions, the Webapp updates
the Database when necessary and sends messages to the Worker.

The Worker generates PDF files with the CLA, comments on and tags pull requests
with the 'cla-missing' label when necessary and processes status updates related
to any in-progress CLA documents from DocuSign Connect API.

### Creating a pull request

When a new pull request is created on a given repository, GitHub sends an HTTP
request to CLA Enforcer's endpoint. CLA Enforcer's API processes the payload and
sends a relevant message to the Worker.

The Worker checks if the author of the pull request is in the Database and has
signed the CLA. If not, the worker leaves a comment on the newly created pull
request using the [`request_signature.md.erb`](lib/templates/request_signature.md.erb)
template and tags the pull request with a 'cla-missing' label.

### Signing the CLA

When a contributor visits the Webapp in order to sign the CLA, they are required
to sign in with their GitHub account via OAuth. This step validates the identity
of the contributor, it doesn't require any extra permissions and uses only the
public information of the contributor.

Once they've signed in, the Webapp displays a pre-filled form that includes
their GitHub username, full name, email and company name. Upon submission of
this form, the Webapp sends a message to the Worker.

The Worker generates a PDF file from the [`cla.html.erb`](lib/templates/cla.html.erb)
template and emails it to the email address provided by the contributor using
DocuSign's API. It also provides the Webapp's endpoint for document status
change updates and stores the DocuSign identifier for the document in the
Database.

### Receiving status updates from DocuSign

When a document is sent, viewed or signed, the DocuSign API will send an HTTP
request to a Webapp endpoint.

The Webapp will process the request payload and send a message to the Worker.

The Worker will update the status of the document in the Database. If the CLA
has been completed, the worker will check the database for any pull requests
that are pending signature from the contributor and will proceed to comment on
them using the [`cla_signed.md.erb`](lib/templates/cla_signed.md.erb) template
as well as remove the 'cla-missing' labels.
